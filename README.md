## Overview
This repository contains the solutions to two tasks assigned during the assessment: predicting flower species and building a movie recommendation system.

## Task 1: Predicting Flower Species
In this task, I employed machine learning techniques to predict the species of flowers based on certain features. The dataset provided was preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables. I explored various algorithms such as Logistic regression, and Gradient Boosting to find the best model for the prediction. The final model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are provided in the corresponding notebook.

This dataset contains information about flowers with the attributes like:
`Id: Unique identifier for each entry.`
`Sepal Length (cm): Length of the sepal in centimeters.`
`Sepal Width (cm): Width of the sepal in centimeters.`
`Petal Length (cm): Length of the petal in centimeters.`
`Petal Width (cm): Width of the petal in centimeters.`
`Species: The species of the flower.`

## Task 2: Movie Recommendation System
For the movie recommendation system task, I implemented collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies to users based on their past preferences and ratings. I used the MovieLens dataset and explored different collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based and item-based approaches. Additionally, The notebook contains an evaluation of the recommendation system using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## File Structure
- `flower_species_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for predicting flower species.
- `movie_recommendation_system.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the movie recommendation system.
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used in both tasks.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the notebooks.

## Getting Started
To run the notebooks, you will need:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to execute the notebooks.
- Required libraries listed in the notebooks (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy).
or
- Run this in Google Colab with necessary libraries imported


Open the notebooks `'flower_species_prediction.ipynb'` and `'movie_recommendation_system.ipynb'` and execute the cells to see the analysis and results.

## Conclusion
These tasks provided valuable insights into machine learning techniques and collaborative filtering algorithms.
